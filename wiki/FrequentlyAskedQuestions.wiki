== What is dynamic_rfi ? ==
dynamic_rfi (dynamic_remote_file_inclusion) is a special mode of fimap.

If you want to use RFI by hand you usually have to upload your payloads to a server and execute them thru a FI bug on the victim server.

But why shouldn't a tool do that stuff for you? 

You can choose between 'local' and 'ftp' mode.

Based on your mode, fimap will automaticly copy the payloads to either your local machine or the given ftp server, execute them and finally delete them.

With dynamic_rfi enabled you can scan and exploit RFI without uploading one single file (by hand).
