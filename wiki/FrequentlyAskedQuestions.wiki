== What's a clean\dirty inclusion? ==
=== Clean inclusion ===
A clean inclusion doesn't have any appendix.
For example the PHP code: 
{{{
<? include($_GET["inc"]); ?>
}}}
will produce a clean inclusion bug.

=== Dirty inclusion ===
A dirty inclusion have a forced appendix.
For example the PHP code: 
{{{
<? include($_GET["inc"] . ".php"); ?> 
}}}
will produce a dirty inclusion bug.

== What is dynamic_rfi ? ==
dynamic_rfi (dynamic_remote_file_inclusion) is a special mode of fimap.

If you want to use RFI by hand you usually have to upload your payloads to a server and execute them thru a FI bug on the victim server.

But why shouldn't a tool do that stuff for you? 

You can choose between 'local' and 'ftp' mode.

Based on your mode, fimap will automaticly copy the payloads to either your local machine or the given ftp server, execute them and finally delete them.

Also (which is only possible with dyn_rfi) you can exploit includes like:
  * <? include($_GET["inc"] . "/lang/index.php"); ?> 
where no Null-Byte is possible. The dyn_rfi "engine" will create needed folders and files automaticly. No headache!
With this in mind you can imagine that RFI scanning with dyn_rfi enabled is more efficient than just trying a few remote sites.

To test if you have dyn_rfi correctly configured you can start fimap with --test-rfi

== If I start fimap I get an error: ==
Error: {{{`[`WARN`]` open() got an unexpected keyword argument 'timeout' }}}
=== Solutions ===
  * ~~Please make sure you use Python 2.6. Afaik the timeout argument is not supported in Python 2.5.~~ fimap is 2.5 compatible now.
  * Download alpha >= v.03 from the download page.
  * Use the SVN snapshot.

Error: {{{`File "C:\Python25\lib\ntpath.py", line 90, in join assert len(path) > 0 TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()`}}}
=== Solutions ===
  * You are on Windows using version < .5 I believe. Download fimap >= .6 which is Windows compatible from the download page.

== I have spawned a shell on a foreign server. Will the police find me?==
YES! They will find you and bust you! 

*DON'T USE THIS TOOL ON SERVERS WHERE YOU DONT HAVE PERMISSION TO PENTEST OR YOU'RE IN JAIL FASTER THAN SPEED OF LIGHT!*
