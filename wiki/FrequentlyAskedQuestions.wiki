== What does the 'fi' in fimap stand for? ==
File Inclusion.
----
== What's a clean\dirty inclusion? ==
=== Clean inclusion ===
A clean inclusion doesn't have any appendix.
For example the PHP code: 
{{{
<? include($_GET["inc"]); ?>
}}}
will produce a clean inclusion bug.

=== Dirty inclusion ===
A dirty inclusion have a forced appendix.
For example the PHP code: 
{{{
<? include($_GET["inc"] . ".php"); ?> 
}}}
will produce a dirty inclusion bug.

----

== What is dynamic_rfi ? ==
dynamic_rfi (dynamic_remote_file_inclusion) is a special mode of fimap.

If you want to use RFI by hand you usually have to upload your payloads to a server and execute them thru a FI bug on the victim server.

But why shouldn't a tool do that stuff for you? 

You can choose between 'local' and 'ftp' mode.

Based on your mode, fimap will automaticly copy the payloads to either your local machine or the given ftp server, execute them and finally delete them.

Also (which is only possible with dyn_rfi) you can exploit includes like:
  * <? include($_GET["inc"] . "/lang/index.php"); ?> 
where no Null-Byte is possible. The dyn_rfi "engine" will create needed folders and files automaticly. No headache!
With this in mind you can imagine that RFI scanning with dyn_rfi enabled is more efficient than just trying a few remote sites.

To test if you have dyn_rfi correctly configured you can start fimap with --test-rfi

----

== Are the possible inclusions in the fimap.log file dangerous? ==
Yes! This means usually that fimap has found a FI-Bug but hasn't any readable files.
In that case it could be possible to upload (for example) a manipulated Image and use this as inclusion point! Take care!
----
== I have spawned a shell on a foreign server. Will the police find me?==
YES! They will find you and bust you! 

*DON'T USE THIS TOOL ON SERVERS WHERE YOU DONT HAVE PERMISSION TO PENTEST OR YOU'RE IN JAIL FASTER THAN SPEED OF LIGHT!*

----
== Why the hell then can this tool spawn a shell if I am not allowed to use it? ==
It's because this tool should provide you a realistic and easy way to test how secure your server really is. Maybe you host different sites for different customers - in that case you can see how vulnerable your whole system is if one of your customer "codes" an inclusion-bug. You can see how deep the impact is if your customers have spent too few time and love to the security.
----
== I have found a bug! How should I report it? ==
First of all download the SVN version and verify that your bug still exists in the SVN snapshot. If it's fixed thanks for your time!
If not feel free to file a new bug in the issues tracker here!
I usually fix bugs very quickly so if you are annoyed of a bug it's in your interest to report it :)
----
== Can I join development? ==
Sure! But currently I want to code fimap how I like it. It's currently (January 2010) 4 month old and I am still not happy with some points of fimap. 
Once I am happy with it you guys are welcome join the development team. 

But if you have a great patch ready and you think that I *have* to add it hardly, send it to me! :)

== Where do you come from? ==
