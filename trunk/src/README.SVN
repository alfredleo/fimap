Hi SVN Users,

If this is the first SVN version which supports multilanguage scanning then
MAKE A BACKUP OF YOUR fimap_result.xml file!

You can fix it in 2 ways:
Solution 1. 
	Delete your fimap_result.xml and let it create a new one (automaticly)
Solution 2.
	Open your fimap_result.xml file with a text editor.
		Search for: mode=
		Replace it with: language='PHP' mode=


Then your XML is ready for the new stuff.
Ofc this will be only in SVN version like this ;)
